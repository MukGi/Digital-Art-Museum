    <p>This is Paul Okafor's black and white variation of Zatanna Zatara. 
        Zatanna is the daughter of magician Giovanni "John" Zatara who 
        appeared in Golden Age comic books and Sindella, a member of

        <h2>Luffy v Doflamingo</h2>

        <p>
            This art piece is inspired by the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece"
             target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">One Piece</a> battle between Luffy and Doflamingo.
            ONE PIECE is a legendary high-seas quest unlike any other. Luffy is a young adventurer
             who has longed for a life of freedom ever since he can remember. He sets off from his small 
             village on a perilous journey to find the legendary fabled treasure, ONE PIECE, 
            to become King of the Pirates!

        <h2>Cammy</h2>
        <img src="ArtWorks\Cammy by Paul.jpg" 
        alt="Cammy by Paul"
        class="imgP">
        <p>This white background portrait piece is called <b>"Cammy".</b>
        It is inspired by the Street Fighter character, and its style is likely drawn based on the new 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_6" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Street Fighter</a>game. <br>
            As we can see from the art, Cammy is a fighter with a slender yet muscular body. She has long blonde hair which she usually 
            wears in two braided pigtails, blue eyes and a scar on her left cheek.
